Sports Venue Booking Service

A Spring Boot backend service that manages sports venues, time slots, availability, and bookings with JWT-based authentication.
This project simulates a real-world sports ground / turf booking system.

The service is fully Dockerized and uses MySQL for persistence.

Features
Core Booking Features

Assumptions

One booking corresponds to exactly one slot

Slots are predefined by venue admins

Slot timings are immutable once booked

Cancelled bookings free the slot immediately

Single MySQL instance (no external cache)

Sports are selected only from the public sports list API

Sports List Constraint

Sports data is fetched from the public API:

GET https://stapubox.com/sportslist/


Only sport_code / sport_id from this API is stored

No hardcoded sports in the database
